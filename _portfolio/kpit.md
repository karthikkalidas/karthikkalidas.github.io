## Experience
![Alt Text](/images/kpit/kpit-pune2.jpg)

I was very fortunate to land an internship at KPIT for summer 2018. I was selected to be part of the ADAS group, focussing on projects involving in enabling Automatic Emergency Braking in commercial vehicles. I had an amazing 2.5 months of work full of enriching learning experiences and fun. I was awarded a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) to join full-time based on my internship performance.

## Project Highlights
- Responsible for designing and testing Plug and Play hardware to enable Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Modeled AEB on Simulink to extract design requirements for actuators and linkages, and simulate vehicle behavior
- Worked on sensor suite integration including solid-state 2D LiDAR, Radars, Camera, and ultrasound sensors
- Evaluated path-planning algorithms such as A star, D star, RRT, RRT start (Global), and DWA (Local) for computational efficiency
- Developed GUI to visualize real-time display of control inputs estimated using Model Predictive Control (MPC)
