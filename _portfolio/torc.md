## About Torc Robotics
Torc, founded by Virginia Tech engineers, gained recognition with a 3rd place win in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. They organically grew by developing autonomous driving tech for defense, mining, and construction. Shifting focus in 2017 to consumer mobility, their Level 4 autonomous system Asimov underwent successful testing. In 2019, Torc partnered with Daimler Trucks to develop highly automated semi-trucks, aiming to serve the growing freight economy.

## Experience
<img src="/images/torc/madras.jpg" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

As Technical Lead at Torc in Albuquerque since April 2023, I oversee vehicle commissioning for an advanced robotic truck platform. I've actively developing automation tools to reduce vehicle commissioning time. Previously, I worked as a System Integration Engineer, collaborating closely with Daimler Truck to integrate autonomy hardware components into their Freightliner Cascadia. I joined Torc in 2021 as a Test Engineer, where I played a pivotal role in integrating next-gen autonomy hardware, enhancing system reliability, and executing comprehensive on-road testing to drive continuous improvements.
