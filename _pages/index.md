I am a System Integration Engineer at [Torc Robotics](https://torc.ai/), working in the field of autonomous trucking. 
I graduated with my master's degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerspace Engineering 
[(MAE)](https://mae.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at The Ohio State University in December 2020. 
I was a part of the Automated Driving Lab [(ADL)](https://mekar.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by 
[Prof. Bilin Aksun Guvenc](https://mekar.osu.edu/people/aksunguvenc.1){:target="_blank"}

Before this, I have done my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay 
[(IITB)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. I have been part of several technical activities at IITB, 
which have instilled in me a passion for solving engineering problems through collaboration, 
supplementing my academics through a practical viewpoint. The
major highlight being my experience in Formula Student, one of the worldâ€™s largest student design competition.

Among other interests, I love to appreciate and experience different arts of life including Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Music, Sports, Dance, Self-help books, Philosophy, Mindfulness, etc. In particular, I love listening to different styles of music (especially fusion), playing the guitar and am always enthusiastic for a game of tennis.
