I am a second year master's student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerspace Engineering [(MAE)](https://mae.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at The Ohio State University expected to graduate in December 2020. I am a part of the Automated Driving Lab [(ADL)](https://mekar.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Bilin Aksun Guvenc](https://mekar.osu.edu/people/aksunguvenc.1){:target="_blank"}. I am passionate about the field of Autonomous Driving and the emerging technologies which will shape the future of transportation.

Before this, I have done my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay [(IITB)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. I have been part of several technical activities at IITB, which have instilled in me a passion for solving
engineering problems through collaboration, supplementing my academics through a practical viewpoint. The
major highlight being my experience in Formula Student, one of the worldâ€™s largest student design competition.

Among other interests, I love to appreciate and experience different arts of life including Music, Sports, Dance, Self-help books, Philosophy, Mindfulness, etc. In particular, I love listening to different styles of music (especially fusion), playing the guitar and am always enthusiastic for a game of tennis.
