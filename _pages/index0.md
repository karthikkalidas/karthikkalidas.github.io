I am a second year master's student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerspace Engineering [(MAE)](https://mae.osu.edu/) at The Ohio State University expected to graduate in December 2020. I am a part of the Automated Driving Lab [(ADL)](https://mekar.osu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Bilin Aksun Guvenc](https://mekar.osu.edu/people/aksunguvenc.1). I am passionate about the field of Autonomous Driving and the emerging technologies which will shape the future of transportation.

I am currently working on developing algorithms for motion prediction and path planning for AVs interacting with pedestrians. The goal is to estimate pedestrains' trajectory in occluded and uncertain dynamic situations and generate trajectories for maneuvering safely in such urban driving scenarios.

Before this, I have done my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay [(IITB)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). I have been part of several technical activities at IITB, which have instilled in me a passion for solving
engineering problems through collaboration, supplementing my academics through a practical viewpoint. The
major highlight being my experience in Formula Student, one of the worldâ€™s largest student design competition.

Among other interests, I love to appreciate and experience different arts of life - Music, Sports, Dance, Self-help books, Philosophy, Mindfulness, etc. In particular, I love listening to different styles of music (especially fusion), playing the guitar and am always enthusiastic for a game of tennis.
