[Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student) is one of the world’s largest student engineering design competition with entries from around the world. Entrants compete to design, build and race a formula style single seater racing car – providing undergraduates with invaluable real-world project experience as they begin their engineering career. Video shows it all

## About [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/)

India's premier Formula Student Electric team participating in Formula Student UK at Silverstone circuit, UK. You can see EVoK, our 11th season car that I was part of in action with live commentary:

## Tips for novice teams

- Even though there is a ton of advice on online forums (check out [Claude Roulle](https://optimumg.com/claude-rouelles-101-tips-for-formula-student-competition-participants/), [Pat Clarke](https://www.formulastudent.de/pr/news/details/article/pats-corner-back-to-basics/) and other online fs forums), I thought to write down some other non-technical learnings that could apply to novice, especially Indian teams
- Incorporate a first principles thinking early on. I love elon's [thought process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgw-_hlFQk4)
- Clearly defined (in numbers) goals. ex: 500Kms of testing, 3 mock scuts, etc. After a gruelling year of seeing the car run in FSUK19, we were hit by a "your best is not good enough" [statement](https://www.facebook.com/iitbracing/posts/pfbid0pnRxE6AwvfEcJDV9nmFAgDUPEwmDuKFMocPJUn1tUgMf1bRTpLLGi1c4bxKBbvb9l?comment_id=2349860471728150)
- Raise self-image of your team and racecar. Budget is never a reason - dont work with dirty tools, equipment, mindset. Not building rickshaws here. Plan budget on lab organization
- Plan timeline backwards - 12 months to compi -> 3 months to mock scrut deadline -> need to get chassis built by so and so
- Try to list down all tech and non-tech risks in FMEA, not just electrical. Form a contigency plan based on risk impact (whatever metric you use). What happens if your driveshaft fractures - have a reliable backup
- Fail quickly and early

## Memoirs and Reflection

- One of the proudest moments in life to see a racecar built mostly from scratch on the circuit. Fell to tears during Autocorss
- Perfect flow state of learning in multiple aspects of life and business - project management, engineering from first principles, teamwork, cost management, ...
- Would I leave everything and do this all over again? Absolutely, given I get my old team back
