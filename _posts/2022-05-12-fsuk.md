## About Formula Student

[Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student) (FS) is one of the world’s largest student engineering design competition with entries from around the world, including USA, Australia, India, Canada and the Far East, as well as a wealth of European teams. Entrants compete to design, build and race a formula style single seater racing car – providing undergraduates with invaluable real-world project experience as they begin their engineering career. It is run by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers [(IMechE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers) and uses the same rules as the original Formula SAE with supplementary regulations.
