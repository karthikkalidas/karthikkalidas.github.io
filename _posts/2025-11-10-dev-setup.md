Took me a while to figure some of these out so wanted to share. These are just opinions, you do you.

### OS

[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) (Arch Linux)

- minimal, beautiful
- can run Steam games

### Keyboard

Needs to be

- Ergonomic
- Close to mouse
- If rich, try [Kinesis Advantage](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/)

### Code Editor

vim motions are arguably superior

- Learn vim if you wanna gigachad (Neovim btw)
  - I like Lazyvim with some minimal [config changes](https://github.com/karthikkalidas/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim)
- I used vscode with vim extension for ~yr
  - vim plugin not kept upto date
  - works fine if you are ok with occasionally having to use the mouse

### Browsing

Brave with vimium, dark-reader

### Keybindings

- Learn tmux
- Get a windows manager that can load predefined windows
  - I use WindowsButton + # : Goto window
    - 1 terminal
    - 2 browser
    - 3 slack
    - 4 misc
  - For apps:
    - Brave: Alt + # : Goto
    - tmux: ctrl + b + #
    - Neovim: <leader> + # using [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
  - Can reconfigure most things
- Takes time to remember these hotkeys, but pays dividends

### Using multiple machines

- Stick to one OS if possible, Arch btw
- Mac vs Linux
  - TODO: Remapping technique
  - TODO: Mac window manager
- Setup [dotfiles](https://github.com/karthikkalidas/dotfiles) repo, one liner setup script that uses stow, etc.
- Primarily use one editor
