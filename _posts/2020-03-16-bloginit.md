Hello! This is my first [blog](https://karthikkalidas.github.io/blog/) post after nights of trying to get it running. It all started with a thought - "Why should I try to fit all I have done into a resume, let me create my own portfolio!". With absolutely no idea of web dev, I was stuck googling ways to create a website the easiest and most hackable way. Here I have listed guides I felt useful in going about this with its own set of pro and cons. Ultimately I took up the challenge of creating the website using Jekyll. With exisiting themes (Minimal Mistakes) and seamless markdown to HTML conversion, I felt it to be an easy journey with future hacks possible in case needed.

I have planned to maintain blogs and my portfolio here. Given that I love to document, I'll keep updating my latest development and progress. The blog section from the developer world will be kept to share my experiences and opinions on stuff and will be open for discussion. Hope its fun!
