why a blog?

- to pass on short and to the point information that can be useful to someone
- to provide pure good will information. Tired of too much stimulating content, ads, clickbait on the internet
- document stuff since i have a terrible memory
- cant replace authenticity these days with a language model

Posts will also be posted on Medium to increase visibility
